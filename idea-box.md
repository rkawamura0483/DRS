## 1. Self-Correcting Adaptive Inference Scheduling

A comprehensive framework to make the inference process dynamic and self-correcting by having the model adapt its generation strategy in real-time based on its own uncertainty.

*   [ ] **Problem Validation:** Does the problem exist?
    *   Yes. The core of Fast-dLLM relies on two key hyperparameters that are set statically: the cache block size (B) and the confidence threshold (τ). The paper's own analysis shows that B=32 and τ=0.9 are a good general compromise, but a single static setting is unlikely to be optimal for the entire duration of a complex generation, which may have phases of high and low uncertainty. Furthermore, the cache re-computation for all preceding tokens is computationally redundant.

*   [ ] **Hypothesis:** Is the proposed method effective?
    *   We hypothesize that a diffusion LLM equipped with a lightweight, training-free "inference scheduler" that dynamically adjusts the generation block size, parallel decoding confidence, and cache update strategy based on real-time model confidence metrics will achieve superior performance on the accuracy-throughput frontier compared to the static Fast-dLLM. The system can allocate computation aggressively during "easy" parts of a generation and conservatively during "hard" or uncertain parts.

*   [ ] **Feasibility:** Is the method feasible to implement?
    *   Yes, highly feasible. The approach remains training-free. The scheduling logic is a meta-algorithm wrapped around the core inference loop. The required metrics (softmax probabilities, entropy) are readily available from the model's output at each step. Implementing the control logic and tiered cache is an engineering task, not a fundamental modeling challenge.

*   [ ] **Detailed Breakdown & Novelty:** What are the components and why are they novel?
    1.  **Dynamic Block Sizing:** The scheduler determines the size of the *next* block based on the average confidence of the *last* block. If confidence was high, increase the next block size; if low, decrease it. This adapts computation to the model's certainty.
    2.  **Adaptive Confidence Thresholding:** The confidence threshold `τ` is adjusted for the next step based on the entropy of the current predictions. High uncertainty raises `τ` to be more cautious; low uncertainty lowers `τ` to be more parallel.
    3.  **Tiered Cache Updates:** A novel cache management strategy.
        *   **Tier 1 (Frozen):** Prompt KV values are computed once and never updated.
        *   **Tier 2 (Stable):** KV values for older, high-confidence generated blocks are updated infrequently.
        *   **Tier 3 (Active):** KV values for the most recent block are updated after each step.
        This tiered approach directly tackles the cache update bottleneck for long sequences.

*   [ ] **Evaluation Plan:** How do we test this?
    1.  Implement and test each of the three components individually against the Fast-dLLM baseline to ablate their contributions.
    2.  Implement and test the fully integrated scheduler.
    3.  Focus evaluation on long-context benchmarks (e.g., few-shot GSM8K, long-form question answering, story generation) where the benefits will be most pronounced.
    4.  Primary metrics: End-to-end latency/throughput and task-specific accuracy (e.g., GSM8K pass@1). The goal is to push the accuracy-vs-throughput frontier.

## 2. Adaptive Block-Sizing with Semantic Change Detection

A focused version of the dynamic block sizing idea, using semantic similarity as the control signal.

*   [ ] **Problem Validation:** Does the problem exist?
    *   Yes. Fast-dLLM's fixed block size is a global hyperparameter that does not account for the non-uniform rate of information change in generated text.

*   [ ] **Hypothesis:** Is the proposed method effective?
    *   An adaptive block-sizing strategy, which dynamically terminates a block when it detects a significant semantic shift in the generated content, will achieve a superior throughput-accuracy trade-off compared to a fixed block size.

*   [ ] **Feasibility:** Is the method feasible to implement?
    *   Very high. It is training-free and requires minimal implementation overhead. The control logic involves calculating the cosine similarity of token embeddings between steps, which is computationally cheap. The main risk is tuning the similarity threshold, which is a single, easily searchable hyperparameter.

*   [ ] **Novelty:** What's new about this?
    *   This is the first application of semantic change detection to control the KV cache block size for a diffusion LLM. It's an elegant, data-driven approach to a previously static hyperparameter.

*   [ ] **Evaluation Plan:** How do we test this?
    *   Compare this dynamic method against a range of fixed block sizes (e.g., 8, 16, 32, 64) on benchmarks like GSM8K and MBPP.
    *   Plot accuracy vs. throughput for all methods. The goal is for the adaptive method's curve to be superior to all fixed-size curves.
    *   Analyze the generated block sizes to confirm the model is using longer blocks for formulaic text and shorter blocks for complex reasoning steps.

## 3. Task-Adaptive Confidence Scheduling

This idea focuses on making the confidence threshold for parallel decoding dynamic and task-aware.

*   [ ] **Problem Validation:** Does the problem exist?
    *   Yes. The global confidence threshold `τ` in Fast-dLLM is a one-size-fits-all solution. However, optimal confidence levels likely differ between tasks (e.g., creative writing might benefit from lower confidence, while math requires high confidence).

*   [ ] **Hypothesis:** Is the proposed method effective?
    *   A task-adaptive confidence scheduler, which selects an optimal confidence threshold `τ` based on the identified task type, will outperform a fixed global threshold on a mixed-task workload.

*   [ ] **Feasibility:** Is the method feasible to implement?
    *   High. This can be implemented in several ways with varying complexity.
        *   **Easiest:** Use hand-crafted presets for different task keywords found in the prompt (e.g., if "python" in prompt, use `τ_code=0.95`).
        *   **Moderate:** Train a small, auxiliary prompt classifier to select a schedule. This adds a trivial one-time training cost.
        *   **Hardest:** Use meta-learning to derive optimal schedules, which is a larger research project.

*   [ ] **Novelty:** What's new about this?
    *   It generalizes the common concept of task-specific decoding parameters (like temperature) to the confidence mechanism of parallel decoding in dLLMs. It's a targeted improvement for making Fast-dLLM more robust across diverse use cases.

*   [ ] **Evaluation Plan:** How do we test this?
    *   Create a benchmark dataset with a mix of tasks (e.g., math, code, QA, creative writing).
    *   Implement the preset or classifier-based scheduler.
    *   Compare the performance (accuracy and throughput) of the adaptive scheduler against the best-performing single global `τ` on this mixed benchmark.

## 4. Joint Training for "Cacheability"

A more radical idea that breaks the training-free constraint to co-design the model and inference engine.

*   [ ] **Problem Validation:** Does the problem exist?
    *   Yes. The Fast-dLLM inference engine is designed for a model that is completely unaware of the caching strategy. The model's activations are not optimized to be "cache-friendly," which limits the effectiveness of the KV-cache approximation.

*   [ ] **Hypothesis:** Is the proposed method effective?
    *   Introducing a lightweight, auxiliary "cacheability" objective during fine-tuning will encourage the model to generate more stable KV activations. This will enable the use of larger cache blocks in Fast-dLLM, leading to greater acceleration with less approximation error.

*   [ ] **Feasibility:** Is the method feasible to implement?
    *   Low. This is a "moonshot" idea with high costs and risks.
        *   **Cost:** It requires a full model fine-tuning pipeline, including large datasets and significant GPU compute, slowing down the research cycle immensely.
        *   **Risk:** The new training objective could interfere with the primary diffusion loss, potentially degrading model quality in hard-to-predict ways. The trade-off might be difficult to balance.

*   [ ] **Novelty:** What's new about this?
    *   Extremely high. This is a paradigm shift from post-hoc inference optimization to a holistic model-inference co-design. It's a systems-level approach that could yield step-function improvements if successful.

*   [ ] **Evaluation Plan:** How do we test this?
    *   Fine-tune a dLLM (e.g., LLaDA) with the combined loss function `L_total = L_diffusion + λ * L_cacheability`.
    *   Perform an ablation study by sweeping the regularization hyperparameter `λ`.
    *   For the best resulting model, compare its performance (accuracy and max speedup with large blocks) using Fast-dLLM against the original model using Fast-dLLM.
